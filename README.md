## What is this sorcery?

Ever been in desperate need of calculating a rectangle's area and perimeter but your calculator app just feels too mainstream? Fear not! This C program will come to your rescue with blazing-fast calculations and command-line coolness.

## Features that will change your life

- Calculates rectangle area with mind-blowing accuracy
- Determines perimeter with precision that would make Euclid proud
- Takes command-line arguments like a boss
- Prints results with formatting so beautiful you might shed a tear
- Error handling that gently reminds you how many arguments to use

## How to wield this geometric power

```bash
# Compile with your favorite C compiler
gcc rectangle.c -o rectangle

# Run with height and width arguments
./rectangle 5 10

# Prepare to be amazed by the output
```

## Example Output

```
The height is: 5
The width is: 10
The perimeter is: 30
The area is: 50
```

## Requirements

- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of what a rectangle is
- The ability to type two numbers

## Technical Specifications

This high-performance rectangle analysis tool uses:
- Integer arithmetic for lightning-fast calculations
- Command-line argument parsing with error handling
- State-of-the-art printf technology for beautiful output
- Advanced mathematical algorithms (a = h √ó w, p = 2h + 2w)

## Future Enhancements

- Triangle calculations (once we master the complex mathematics)
- Circle support (œÄ is still being researched)
- 3D cube volume (we're waiting for the 4th dimension to be confirmed)
